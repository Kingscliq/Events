if the user clicks on the login button, 
a request is sent to the server for an access token
once the token arrives,
store token in local storage
get the token from local storage
make another request to verify the access token,
//
if token is valid ? send user details : redirect the user to the login page
if user details ? 
store the details to the local storage and redirect the user to the homepage
//
i will always get the user from the local storage and 
store it in state to be accessed globally by the entire application routes
